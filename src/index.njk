  <h2 class="mt-6 font-displayOne text-2xl">What we do</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">Are invasive species like english ivy, privet and kudzu crowding your natural habitat?</p>
  <p class="mt-4">goat folx works with the Earth’s tools to clear the way for environmental restoration of
residential, commercial, and industrial green spaces. Our hungry billygoats will feast away the invasive species that are actively strangling the life out of your trees and bushes to clear a path for the cultivation of a native landscape that will thrive in the refreshed and fertilized soil that our
    goats leave behind.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">The humans at goat folx are committed to developing native habitats that will thrive here in the
sunny south. Beyond clearing space, goat folx offers advice, design, and installation of native
plants, especially those most suited to sustainable living practices such as herbs and other wild
medicinals, edible fruit-bearing plants, native ornamentals, and in-ground and water-conserving
container vegetable gardens. We are inspired to utilize permaculture design techniques to work
with the earth’s natural processes to manage and conserve water on your property, develop
        your soil and prepare your natural habitat to care for itself as it flourishes.</p>
